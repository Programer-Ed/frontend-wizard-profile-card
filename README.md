# 🚀 Frontend Wizards — Stage 0: Profile Card

Welcome to **Stage 0** of the Frontend Wizards Challenge!  
This project is my submission for the task: **Build a Testable Profile Card** using **plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS**.

---

## ✨ Overview

The Profile Card is a small, accessible, and responsive component designed to demonstrate core frontend principles — semantic HTML, responsive layouts, accessibility, and testability using `data-testid` attributes.

All required elements and attributes are implemented according to the challenge specs.
