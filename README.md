# 🚀 Frontend Wizards — Stage 0: Profile Card + Bonus Pages

Welcome to **Stage 0** of the Frontend Wizards Challenge!
This project began as a simple **Profile Card**, but has now grown into a **mini personal site** — complete with **About** and **Contact** pages, **responsive navigation**, and a **cohesive design system** built purely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS**.

---

## ✨ Overview

The project demonstrates mastery of the core frontend fundamentals — semantic HTML, accessible layouts, testable components, and smooth responsive design.
In addition to the profile card, it now includes two reflective pages that expand on personal growth, communication, and self-awareness.

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Semantic HTML5 structure** — clear use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
✅ **Consistent design language** — shared styles across all pages
✅ **Testable elements** — `data-testid` attributes included per spec
✅ **Responsive layout** — optimized for both desktop and mobile screens
✅ **Accessible and lightweight** — minimal dependencies, clear color contrast

✅ **About page** — reflective, includes:

* **Bio** (`data-testid="test-about-bio"`)
* **Goals in this program** (`data-testid="test-about-goals"`)
* **Areas of low confidence** (`data-testid="test-about-confidence"`)
* **Note to future self** (`data-testid="test-about-future-note"`)
